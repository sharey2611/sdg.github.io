I have done this project to revise/brush-upmy concepts on numerics, towards the project involving Finite Difference, initially, but Finitie Volume Method in general (majorly). Furthermore, I have attempted to implement CUDA in calculation heavy part of the project. In the end, I have attempted to implement the Machine Learning to the project.
